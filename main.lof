Couette flow is imposed by moving top and bottom wall in $y$-direction with speed $u_0$ and $-u_0$, respectively. Poiseuille flow is imposed by applying a pressure gradient \emph {$G$} along $y$-direction. Director field ${\bf n}$ is represented by a polar angle $\theta $ and an azimuthal angle $\phi $.}}{4}{figure.caption.5}%
