	\caption{ {\bf Simulation setup.} Two walls are in $z$-direction separated by a distance of \emph{$L_z$}. Easy axis is in the $y$-direction. Couette flow is imposed by moving top and bottom wall in $y$-direction with speed $u_0$ and $-u_0$, respectively. Poiseuille flow is imposed by applying a pressure gradient \emph{$G$} along $y$-direction. Director field ${\bf n}$ is represented by a polar angle $\theta$ and an azimuthal angle $\phi$.}

In this study, we conduct all the simulation in this flat channel Fig.~\ref{fig2:setup}.
