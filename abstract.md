\subsection{Investigation of Active Traffic and The Basic Rule by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning } 

 In human society, lots of the traffic rule form naturally by phenomenological deduction and different countries or regions follows different traffic rule. The traffic in real world in our daily life follows different rules to prevent traffic jamming, traffic accident and improves the efficiency of the transportation. We would like to know that if there those rules can be evolved by a artificial intelligent. 
 
 In this work, we use the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) as a tool and we build the physical scenario as the working environment. Different traffic scenarios are prepared in the MARL, a bi-pass way and a crossing. We employ the Ray and rllib package to accelerate the reinforcement learning.
 
 We preliminarily find the right/left-hand side driving rule in the bi-pass way scenario and the moves over to the right when encounters a turn in the crossing scenario. We would like to explore more about the traffic rules in the MARL and also find the governing policy for those autonomous choice.
